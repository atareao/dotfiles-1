My first rice. I wanted to make it as simple and out of the way as possible, with colors from the [Ayu color schemes](https://github.com/ayu-theme/ayu-colors).

**OS:** Arch  
**WM:** Sway  
**Terminal:** urxvt  
**Shell:** fish  
**Bar:** Waybar  
**Fonts:** SF Pro Text *(UI)*, Hack *(Terminal)*, Iosevka *(Bar)*  
**GTK:** [Ayu-Mirage-Dark](https://github.com/dnordstrom/ayu-theme/tree/ayu-mirage)
*(Customized [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme))*  
**Kvantum:** [AyuMirage](https://github.com/dnordstrom/ayu-kde) *(Customized [Arc](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde/tree/master/Kvantum))*  
**Icons:** Papirus-Dark  
**Wallpaper:**

* GTK theme is a customized Arc with a few colors changed to match Ayu/Ayu-Mirage/Ayu-Dark (different Git branches). For QT, a customized Arc Kvantum theme (a tad bit too dark, SVG needs work).
* Papirus icons changed to orange with [papirus-folders](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/papirus-folders-git/).
* Created light, mirage, and dark versions for GTK (separate branches in the repo), QT, and Xresources. Haven't really used the light ones yet, so they may be sub-optimal. For Xresources there's also a reduced brightness light version that is more legible as terminal color scheme.
* Also ported the Ayu colors to Termite in case I feel like using a Wayland-native terminal emulator.
* The fish prompt is "Robbyrussell" with the "dirty Git repo" glyph changed to a plus sign due to urxvt being a little bitch about it.
* Looks pretty nice with the default Arc themes as well, in my opinion.

**Note:** Only the GTK and Kvantum themes have been edited from Arc, not stuff I
don't use (XFWM, Konsole, etc.).
