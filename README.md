My first rice. I wanted to make it as simple and out of the way as possible, with colors from the Ayu color schemes.

* GTK theme is a customized Arc with a few colors changed to match Ayu/Ayu-Mirage/Ayu-Dark (different Git branches). For QT, a customized Arc Kvantum theme (a tad bit too dark, SVG needs work).
* Papirus icons changed to orange with [papirus-folders](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/papirus-folders-git/).
* Created light, mirage, and dark versions for GTK (separate branches in the repo), QT, and Xresources. Haven't really used the light ones yet, so it may be sub-optimal. For Xresources there's also a reduced brightness light version that is more legible as terminal color scheme.
* Also ported the Ayu colors to Termite in case I feel like using a Wayland-native terminal emulator.
* The fish prompt is "Robbyrussell" with the "dirty Git repo" glyph changed to a plus sign due to urxvt being a little bitch about it.
* Looks pretty nice with the default Arc themes as well, in my opinion.
